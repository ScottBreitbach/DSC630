## Load required libraries for models that we are testing
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(forecast)
library(nnet)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart)
library(earth)
library(performance)
library(see)
library(rpart.plot)
library(patchwork)
```

## Load the data sets

This loads up the data sets dfTraining and dfAnalysis so we can use them to create models
```{r loaddata, include=TRUE}
rm(list = ls())
df <- read.csv("dfTrain1.csv") 
```

## Decision Tree
Create a decision tree model
```{r dt, include=TRUE}
# Decision Tree
tree <- rpart(formula = SalePrice ~ OverallQual + YearBuilt + YearRemodAdd + TotalBsmtSF + GrLivArea + GarageCars + GarageArea + BsmtQual_Ex + KitchenQual_Ex, data = df, minsplit = 20, minbucket = 7,     xval = 10, maxdepth = 20, cp = 1e-05, usesurrogate = 0, surrogatestyle = 0)

```
Decision Tree plot
```{r dtp, include=TRUE}
# Visualize the decision tree with rpart.plot
rpart.plot(tree, box.palette="RdBu", shadow.col="gray", nn=TRUE)
```


## Linear Regression
Regression Model
```{r reg1, include=TRUE}
# Linear Regression (using variables that are high correlation)
reg <- lm(formula = SalePrice ~ OverallQual + YearBuilt + YearRemodAdd + TotalBsmtSF + GrLivArea + GarageCars + BsmtQual_Ex + KitchenQual_Ex, data = df)

# Model Performance
print(reg)
r2(reg)
model_performance(reg)

#Visualization of model checks
check_model(reg)
```

## Neural Network

Adding a neural network model

```{r nn, include=TRUE}
# Neural Network
nn <-nnet.formula(formula = SalePrice ~ OverallQual + YearBuilt + YearRemodAdd + TotalBsmtSF + GrLivArea + GarageCars + GarageArea + BsmtQual_Ex + KitchenQual_Ex, data = df, size = 10, linout = TRUE, rang = c(0.7), decay = 0.1, MaxNWts = 1000, maxit = 100)

```
